--Q.2
Use different levels of language: avoid jargon for non-experts, but include it for experts.
Break down complex concepts into simpler steps for beginners, and offer detailed technical insight for advanced users.
Include examples, analogies, and visuals tailored to the audience’s familiarity with the subject.
--Q.3
Conduct surveys or research on the audience’s background.
Use analytics from previous materials or similar documentation to assess the type of audience.
Start with simpler explanations and gradually increase complexity, adjusting based on feedback.

Using "start" instead of "initiate" or "end" instead of "terminate" improves readability because most people are more familiar with simpler terms. This lowers the cognitive load and helps readers understand faster.
--Q.7
Examples provide practical applications that help readers relate abstract concepts to real-world scenarios. Visuals, such as diagrams, flowcharts, or screenshots, help illustrate relationships and processes that might be hard to grasp through text alone.
--Q.8
Diagrams: Effective for explaining system architecture or workflows.
Charts (bar, line, pie): Useful for presenting data comparisons, trends, or distributions.
Screenshots: Ideal for showing software interfaces or step-by-step instructions.
Flowcharts: Great for visualizing processes or decision-making paths.
--Q.9
Headings and subheadings break content into organized sections, making it easier for readers to scan and find the information they need. They provide a clear structure, improving navigation and guiding the reader through complex topics.
--Q.10
Make headings clear and descriptive.
Use concise language to summarize the section’s content.
Maintain consistent formatting for readability.
Use a logical hierarchy (main headings, subheadings) to guide the reader through the document.
--Q.11
A brief overview of the product’s main functionality.
A sentence or two about the product’s purpose.
